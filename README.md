## Overview

### Links
- Live Site URL: [Github Pages](https://pikruse.github.io/recipe-page)

## My process
Once again, I laid out the html, did some basic flex positioning and style formatting, and then went back and perfected the details

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm getting a lot better at flexbox, and I'm able to make sure that my sites adjust to various screen sizes, which is super nice.

### Continued development

I'm not sure how to get the details in these projects to match up exactly with the screenshot. It's pretty annoying. That's something that I want to work on.
